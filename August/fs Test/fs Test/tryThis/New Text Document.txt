Regular Show was created by J.G. Quintel. The series centers around best friends Mordecai and Rigby, who work as groundskeepers at a nondescript park in an American city. Neither of them is all that committed to their work however, as they spend most of the series hanging out and finding ways to have fun with their time in an increasingly absurd world. The show also focuses on a number of supporting characters, including their ever-tense manager Benson, the usually calm Skips, the short-tempered bully Muscle Man and the park's other manager, the eternally giddy Pops.As the show develops, the series introduces a wealth of characters, including the more comedic like Thomas, an excitable intern for the park who's revealed to be a Russian spy and the more dramatic like Margaret, a friendly coffee barista who Mordecai has a relatively realistic relationship with. The series focuses on Mordecai and Rigby discovering more about themselves and their place in the world, becoming more and more mature while dealing with romantic relationships and familial concerns. The series even teases out the cosmic elements of Pops that drag everyone into the greater universe. Commander
