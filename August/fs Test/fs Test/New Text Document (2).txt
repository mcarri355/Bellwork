Adventure Time, created by Pendelton Ward, is a fantasy epic set in a goofy version of a post-apocalyptic world. Centuries after the end of life on earth as we know it, magical life has grown in the ruins of the old world. Now known as the Land of Ooo, bizarre kingdoms have risen up and developed their own political positions. The show primarily focuses on Finn, seemingly the only human remaining in the world. Raised by a family of talking dogs, the preteen Finn has become one of the most famous heroes in all of Ooo. He goes adventuring alongside his older adopted brother, the lazy but well-intentioned shape-shifting dog Jake.

The overarching storyline of the series follows Finn's development from an immature adventurer into a dedicated-but-complex hero. As the show and the world expands, the series introduces more and more shades to the supporting cast as well. This is primarily through the genius inventor Princess Bubblegum, snarky rocker Marceline the Vampire Queen, Finn and Jake's endlessly optimistic and imaginative robot friend BMO and the purposefully pathetic villain known as the Ice King, who is revealed to have a tragic backstory connecting him to many of the other members of the cast and world across centuries.
